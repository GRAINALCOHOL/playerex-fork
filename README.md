### Preamble 📝

PlayerEX is a fundamentally rewritten mod based on the work of **CleverNucleus's [PlayerEx](https://modrinth.com/mod/playerex)**. The mod provides RPG-themed attributes to the game and a configurable leveling system.

### Content 📦

With higher-level, highly configurable attribute modification provided by **[Data Attributes: Directors Cut](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/data-attributes-directors-cut)**, PlayerEX integrates skill and refundable points to spend through the non-intrusive, extendable, and modern screen, which can be activated by a hotkey (default is `-`).

### Extras 🎬

- **[EXHud](https://modrinth.com/mod/exhud-directors-cut)**, which provides an optional, opinionated and highly-configurable UI complimentary for PlayerEX, and has compatibility with other mods, such as [**Thermoo**](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermoo), and [**AppleSkin**](https://modrinth.com/mod/appleskin).

- **[RelicEX](https://modrinth.com/mod/relicex-directors-cut)**, which adds relics, tomes, different ways to obtain level, skill, and refund points.

- **[WizardEX](https://modrinth.com/mod/wizardex-directors-cut)**, which provides a layer between this mod and **[Wizards](https://modrinth.com/mod/wizards)** and other mods that use **[Spell Power Attributes](https://modrinth.com/mod/spell-power)**.

### Wiki 📑

To learn more about the mod, you can go **[here!](https://bareminimumstudios.github.io/Bare-Minimum-Docs/)**

### Developers 💻

Ah, my favorite people. You will get some more information on how to mod PlayerEX once the release is stable. For now, know that you will be getting:

- A way to implement attribute modification (and target any attribute you want and apply functions to them) into a registry.
- Override **any** registered attribute.
- Apply **any** attribute to **any** `LivingEntity` (primarily for the player).
- Attach to a screen using `owo-lib`.
- And much more...

### For Forge Users 🪨

Howdy, I know you have all been **dying** for a forge release. This will come in due time. For now, the mod has been rewritten for fabric, but due to its compatible and improved nature, there is a way you can play it!

*Refer to the **Usage Guide** on [**Sinytra Connector**](https://modrinth.com/mod/connector) to get started.*

> There is no guarantee that it will work for Forge completely, and support **can not** be provided until an actual release of a forge mod is created.
